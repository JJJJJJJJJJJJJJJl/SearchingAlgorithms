Compile:<br/>
```
g++ -Wall main.cpp -o main<br/>
```
<br/>
Execute:<br/>
```
./main<br/>
```
<br/>

First line asks for a number N of points.<br/>
Second line asks for a flag number, 1 so it reads N points from stdin or 2 so randomly it generates N points.<br/>
In case of flag being 1, a point be read as "x y".<br/>
<br/>
It then prints out each algorithm/heuristic solution.<br/>
